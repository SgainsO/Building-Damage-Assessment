# Welcome to Our Project!

## Our Motivation
* When disaster strikes, assessing and rebuilding is a costly, time-consuming process. Our project demonstrates how data science can streamline damage analysis, reducing both costs and recovery time.

### Details
* [Powerpoint with more info on this project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BkbNGrVA0agTMpkpehzaJqENou5NLx1ZeVcW2eblpRU/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Yolo Side Damage Model demo on page 8 

### Installation/Run Reminders
* It is reccomended you run the program in a virtual enviornment, but this is optional
* PIL, Torch, and Ultralytics must all be installed
* We did not include our dataset on this github, so you must provide your own, matching the format in the YAML file created in train.py
* python3 est.py runs the program, make sure the files you want to check are hardcoded in line 146
